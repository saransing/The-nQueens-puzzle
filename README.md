# nQueens Solver in Java

## Description
This repository contains a Java implementation of the classic nQueens problem using a backtracking algorithm. The nQueens problem involves placing \( n \) queens on an \( n \times n \) chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

The implementation is split into two main files:
- `NQueens.java`: Contains the logic for solving the nQueens problem.
- `Main.java`: The entry point of the program, which sets up the problem and invokes the solver.

## How to Run
To run the solver, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Compile the Java files:
4. Run the compiled program:


## Features
- Backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve the nQueens problem.
- Modular code structure for easy readability and maintenance.
- The program can be easily modified to solve for different sizes of the chessboard.

## Customization
You can change the size of the chessboard by modifying the `n` variable in the `Main.java` file
